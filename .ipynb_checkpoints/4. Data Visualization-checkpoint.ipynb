    "Data visualization is a powerful technique that allows us to understand our data. We can use visualizations for a variety of purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To see how a variable changes over time (e.g. do wages among the youth increase or decrease over time?)\n",
    "- To explore relationships between variables (e.g. how does your income change as you get more education?)\n",
    "- To see how data is distributed (e.g. is the data for average income spread out or concentrated around one value?) \n",
    "- And more! \n",
