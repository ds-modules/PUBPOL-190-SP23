    "Over the course of this notebook, you learned and practiced table manipulation techniques like `drop`, `select`, `relabel`, and `astype`. This gives you practice in manipulating data so that you can manipulate data based on your own ideas and hypotheses in the future. In the next notebook, you will build upon coding and quantitative skills you learned today by applying them to more detailed Labor Statistics data from the [US Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/data/). Great work!"
