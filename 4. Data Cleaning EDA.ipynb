We use the code `str.slice(0,5)` to mean take a slice of the string from the 0th index up to the 5th index.

For values that were already 5 digits long, this slice returns itself so nothing changes (ie, `94103` is still `94103`). *This can only be done on a Series (similar to an array) so we used pd.Series to temporarily convert the array of values to a series of values in the below line of code.*"
