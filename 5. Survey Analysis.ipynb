    "In this notebook, you will apply the skills you've learned in the previous 4 notebooks and 1 future notebook to clean and conduct explatory analysis on your own survey data. We will provide guidance on importing your data and setting up basic analysis, but the rest is up to your ideas and your new coding knowledge! Open up previous notebooks for reference and, as always, some resources are provided below.\n",

    "#### Tips/Solutions to Errors:\n",
    "1. Remember that if you get an error that says **SyntaxError**, this means something was typed incorrectly.\n",
    "    - You may be missing a parenthesis\n",
    "    - *I always recommend copy and pasting column names, rather than typing them by memory.*\n",
    "        - For example, `survey.column(\"age\")` would produce a *syntax error* because the column is \"Age\", not \"age\". (Correct code: `survey.column(\"Age\")`. Capitalization and spaces matter so in my opinion it saves time to copy and paste.\n",
    "1. **Label your variables in a way that you understand.**\n",
    "    - If you were to save `survey.column(\"Age\")` to a variable, it make much more sense if it were called: `age_values`, `age_array`, `age_column`, `ages`,  etc. instead of `array`, `x`, `col2`, etc.\n",
    "    - This also makes it easier for you (and classmates) to understand when you're working on your notebook over the span of days or weeks, as you might not remember exactly what you meant by `new_table`.\n",
    "1. Frequently **save your notebook**! This is always good just in case any slip-ups happen.\n",
    "    - You can use Control Z to undo a recent change within cells. You can't un-run a cell, but you can jump back to what your cell was a few seconds before you accidentally deleted the wrong line of code.\n",
    "    - This way you can also revert to an old version by clicking \"File\" and \"Revert to Checkpoint\". \n",
    "    - *Always save your notebook before closing it.*\n",
    "1. If you get a pop-up that your \"**Kernel** is dead\" or if you notice your cells aren't running:<br>\n",
    "   - *First, save what currently exists! (Control+S or File, Save and Checkpoint)*\n",
    "   - Then, go to \"Kernel\" in the menu, then click \"Restart\".\n",
    "   - Once it's restarted, click \"Cell\" then click \"Run All Above\".\n",
    "   - This will run all the cells above the one you're currently on. This is necessary because otherwise the cell that imports packages and that loads your dataset won't have been run and code cells will error when trying to refer to them.\n",
    "   - *Every time you re-open the notebook, remember that you'll need to run cells from the top (by the same logic).*\n",
    "1. Use the resources listed at the top of each notebook if you're having difficulties or feeling stuck!\n",
